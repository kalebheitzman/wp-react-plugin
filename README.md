# WordPress Plugin with ReactJS

This is a sample plugin that shows how to register a ReactKJS App using WordPress's included ReactJS library.

## What's Bundled

- Emotion for CSS Handling
- Babel and Webpack Configuration for active development

## Emotion CSS

I've chosen Emotion to provide CSS support this plugin. Any solution could be implemented, but emotion provides an easy way of styling components without affecting the rest of your css by scoping styles specific to your plugin.

## ReactJS Context

Using React context, we can provide state management using Context and Providers throughout the plugin.
